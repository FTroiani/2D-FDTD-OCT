Sample (s) or reference (r) arm? r
You have chosen to simulate the reference arm.
Grid is 12000 by 2000 cell.
Enter indices for first point in TF region: 5000 1 (I made the pulse start this far into the simulation so that in the cell I was observing the reflected field there was only the reflected field)
Enter indices for last point in TF region: 11999 1999
Enter width of beam in y direction: 100
Enter the points per wavelength for source: 100
Enter the number of photons: 1e12
Enter pulse width: 500 (the pulse width is first given in number of cells and transformed in wavelength in Matlab afterwards)
Do you want 2D snapshots? (1=yes, 0=no) 0
Duration of simulation is 60000 steps.
Enter start time and temporal stride: 0 10
Start time = 0, Temporal stride = 10
In x direction grid has 12000 total nodes (ranging from 0 to 11999).
Enter first node, last node, and spatial stride: 0 11999 10
In the x direction:
First node = 0, Last node = 11999, Spatial stride = 10
In y direction grid has 2000 total nodes (ranging from 0 to 1999).
Enter first node, last node, and spatial stride: 0 1999 10
In y direction:
First node = 0, Last node = 1999, Spatial stride = 10
Enter the output filename: test
Enter the cell in which you want to observe the field: 1000
